            Love and Friendship 
            <br />
            Love is like the wild rose-briar,
            Friendship like the holly-tree—
            The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms
            But which will bloom most constantly?

            The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,
            Its summer blossoms scent the air;
            Yet wait till winter comes again
            And who will call the wild-briar fair?

            Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
            And deck thee with the holly’s sheen,
            That when December blights thy brow
            He still may leave thy garland green.
